# [driver] Slice C0 — deterministic brief (run command-center-2026-08-26)

## Scope (verbatim from hardened plan row — do ONLY this)
HARNESS-CORRECTNESS ONLY. Rewrite e2e/command-center-reminders-fence.spec.ts against the REAL C4 contract. Do not add product routes. Collect ALL of C1-C6 (do not abort after the first fail). Owner session required. C1 schema via DB/temp copy not GET /schema. C2 POST /api/agent-reminders with folder_group plus cadence_minutes plus recipients array. C3 fireDue into a real temp pane (not GET /due). C4 owner-gated GET /active. C5 UI sheet visible. C6 solicit reached only included panes. FENCE_STUB=C3 must force named C5 kind=assert red. Write fence-report-v1.json in finally with verdict_line tokens fence=C6 verdict=PASS or FAIL fault_class=none or implementation or plan. Budget 6 after a4 remaining gaps.

## Acceptance criteria (ACs)
HARNESS-SMOKE

## Focused tests (the row's acceptance)
`FENCE_ID=C6 AGJASSIST_FENCE_DB_MODE=temp-copy node e2e/run-command-center-playwright-fence.mjs --gate`

## Contract
- estimate: 25min · deps: A0,C1,C2,C3,C4,C5 · impl_tier=L3 · val_tier=L3 · budget=6
- Verifier ≠ fixer. Do NOT widen scope beyond the row (any widen = re-plan/EDGE).
- End your terminal DONE callback with the VERDICT-V1 line (see design/VERDICT-V1.md).
