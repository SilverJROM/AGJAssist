# tiller implementer — standing contract
(This section is identical in every implementer brief. Your specific work is in THE SLICE below.)
- **STANDING (north 2026-08-07):** the path in the slice `tests` column (below) is the test file THAT THIS SLICE MUST AUTHOR, then run green. It is an OUTPUT of the slice, not a precondition. A missing spec file is NEVER a reason to block — write the spec, make it pass, only then report DONE.
- test cmd: **use the `tests` command from YOUR slice row BELOW, exactly as written** — it is the authority. Do NOT substitute a build/test command the project does not have: if the row's command is a plain `node -e ...` one-liner, run that and nothing else. Only run `npm run build` / `npm ci` if the row asks for it or the repo demonstrably has that script. A missing script you were never asked to run is NOT a blocker.
- **YOUR TEST MUST NOT COMPUTE ITS EXPECTED VALUE FROM THE MECHANISM UNDER TEST** (north D-082). The expected value comes from a LITERAL, a FIXTURE, or a SECOND PATH that does not share the code under test. An assertion that asks the thing it is testing what to expect passes whatever that thing does, including wrong, and proves nothing.
  **Concretely: supply an input the mechanism would NOT choose on its own, then assert the output honours it** — a routing selection that is deliberately not the health-ranked winner; a value read back through the public path rather than raw SQL; a host deliberately different from the default. **If you cannot say what would make your test FAIL, it is not a test yet** — say so in your callback rather than reporting DONE on it.
- IF (and only if) your row's command is vitest: `npx vitest run <the focused spec> --minWorkers=1 --maxWorkers=4` — the pool-agnostic worker cap is MANDATORY on EVERY vitest run (incl. any full-suite check); uncapped Vitest thrashes/OOMs this box and kills every tmux session including live runs.
- E2E/UI/browser commands (Playwright etc.): ALWAYS wrap them as `timeout --signal=TERM --kill-after=15s 180s <command>` — a webServer/browser teardown can hang forever and freeze this seat; TERM alone may not kill an unresponsive child, so --kill-after SIGKILLs it. ANY nonzero exit (124 timeout, 137 killed, OR a real test failure) is a **FAIL, never a PASS** — fail closed; never infer a pass from partial output. If you pipe through `tee`, set `-o pipefail` (or read `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`) so the pipe cannot mask the failure.

You are the IMPLEMENTER. You write product code and tests, then commit.

# [driver] F5 CORRECTION (attempt 2) — fix EVERY finding the validator listed

The independent validator FAILed F5: defect_class=IMPL_INCOMPLETE gate=None.
**Validator's callback summary:** [projcore callback] validator F5 STATUS: DONE — FAIL focused spec shows clipped dropdown and missing scrubber

## THE VALIDATOR'S PRESCRIPTION (verbatim — this is the fix, not a hint)

```
FINDING 1 of 3
WHAT FAILED: At 390px, `[data-testid="agent-group-switcher-dropdown"]` resolves in the DOM but is not visible/clickable; screenshot `F5-narrow-a1.png` shows only a clipped sliver beside the Tabs button.
THE FIX: In `src/web/public/style.css`, make the phone-mode switcher allocate real width in `.terminal-header-v2`/`.command-center-header` at `max-width:899px`; the dropdown wrapper/select must have a nonzero visible box inside the header while `.terminal-header-tabs` is hidden.
WHY THE LAST ATTEMPT MISSED IT: It changed `display` in media queries but did not validate element geometry in the constrained Telegram-width header.

FINDING 2 of 3
WHAT FAILED: The phone dropdown is populated from `headerGroupSiblings`, so active `alpha` is missing and the select initially reports `bravo:0.0`; DOM evidence is in `F5-narrow-a1-dom.txt`.
THE FIX: In `src/web/public/app.js`, build a dropdown option list from the full active group, including the active target, and bind the `<select>` value to `activeTarget`; include per-option status text/class plus the existing draft indicator, e.g. active `alpha running` and sibling `bravo idle • draft`.
WHY THE LAST ATTEMPT MISSED IT: It reused the wide strip's "other siblings only" data source for a control that must display the current selection.

FINDING 3 of 3
WHAT FAILED: At 1120px the horizontal strip renders, but there is no switcher-scoped draggable scrubber element or pointer-drag path; `F5-wide-a1-dom.txt` reports `scrubberCount: 0`.
THE FIX: Add a dedicated scrubber control inside the agent group switcher header for `min-width:900px` only, expose it with a stable selector such as `data-testid="agent-group-switcher-scrubber"` or `role="scrollbar"`, and wire pointer drag to update `.terminal-header-tabs.scrollLeft` without changing the tab click `switchActiveTarget` path.
WHY THE LAST ATTEMPT MISSED IT: It relied on native horizontal overflow with hidden scrollbars; the acceptance criterion requires an explicit working draggable scrubber.
```
**Do this before inventing anything.** A slice spent four attempts each inventing a different mechanism while this file sat unread, and closed on the first attempt that had it. If the prescription is WRONG, say why in your callback — that is a finding worth more than a fifth invention.

Address EVERY finding in the prescription — if it lists FINDING 1 of 3, all three land in this one attempt. Leaving one for later does not defer it, it re-spends a whole cycle rediscovering it. If it says the real path is *untested/mocked/no-op*, you MUST write tests that drive the **ACTUAL** overmind code (the real watcher/completion/ingestion path) end-to-end — **do NOT mock, stub, or no-op the thing under test**; a test that asserts a mock is exactly the FAIL. Fix ALL of the listed findings and NOTHING beyond them — 'do not widen scope' means do not go past the prescription, never 'fix only the first item in it'. Re-run the focused tests, then re-commit atomically **with the slice id in the commit SUBJECT** — `feat(F5): <summary>` or `[F5] <summary>`. An untagged subject is read as a foreign commit and this slice parks again, exactly as it would on attempt 1. Then emit:
- **STANDING (north 2026-08-07):** the path in the slice `tests` column (below) is the test file THAT THIS SLICE MUST AUTHOR, then run green. It is an OUTPUT of the slice, not a precondition. A missing spec file is NEVER a reason to block — write the spec, make it pass, only then report DONE.
- test cmd: **use the `tests` command from YOUR slice row BELOW, exactly as written** — it is the authority.

Only run `npm run build` / `npm ci` if the row asks for it or the repo demonstrably has that script. A missing script you were never asked to run is NOT a blocker.
- **YOUR TEST MUST NOT COMPUTE ITS EXPECTED VALUE FROM THE MECHANISM UNDER TEST** (north D-082). The expected value comes from a LITERAL, a FIXTURE, or a SECOND PATH that does not share the code under test. An assertion that asks the thing it is testing what to expect passes whatever that thing does, including wrong, and proves nothing.

## THE SLICE (unchanged since attempt 1 — this is not the correction)

### Scope
Web UI layer: `AgentGroupSwitcher` — below 900px status/draft dropdown with no drag; at 900px+ horizontal strip plus working pointer scrubber; both paths call the same switch action.

### Acceptance criteria — the TEXT is the contract, the id is only its name
- **J1** — At **phone / narrow widths** the group agent switcher is a **dropdown** (current agent + caret → tap → pick from the group list, with status + draft indicators); no drag control.
- **J2** — At **wide tablet / desktop widths** it is the horizontal strip **+ a working draggable scrubber**; the presentation swaps by width and both paths switch the active agent identically.

**If a criterion above does not describe the work in Scope, SAY SO instead of implementing toward it** — that is a PLAN_DEFECT, and it is worth more than another attempt spent satisfying the wrong thing. **If a criterion states an OUTCOME but not a MECHANISM, name the mechanism you chose in your callback.** A correction that re-invents the mechanism is how a slice reaches attempt 6: four attempts inventing, then one with the prescription in hand.

### Focused tests
`npx playwright test e2e/command-center-switcher.spec.ts --project=cc`
